.SH NAME
limereg \- manual page for limereg 1.1.0
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B limereg
\fI\,--rfile <reference image> --tfile <template image> \/\fR[\fI\,OPTIONS\/\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
limereg 1.1.0
.PP
limereg \- Lightweight Image Registration
Performs a simple rigid image registration. The image files must be square and grayscale. Supported image formats: *.bmp, *.dib, *.jpeg, *.jpg, *.jpe, *.jp2, *.png, *.pbm, *.pgm, *.ppm, *.sr, *.ras, *.tiff, *.tif.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
Show usage information.
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
Show application version and copyright information.
.TP
\fB\-\-rfile\fR arg
Template image file (will be transformed). The image
must be grayscale colored and it must have even and
square pixel dimensions.
.TP
\fB\-\-tfile\fR arg
Reference image file (will be matched against). The
image must be grayscale colored and it must have even
and square pixel dimensions.
.TP
\fB\-\-outfile\fR arg
Output image file (optional). Gives the option to save
the registered template image.
.TP
\fB\-\-maxiter\fR arg
Max. amount of iterations.
[Optional parameter, default: 150]
.TP
\fB\-\-levels\fR arg
Amount of levels in the multilevel pyramid of shrinked
image copies. 0 means autodetect by the formula
log2(ImageWidth/32).
[Optional parameter, default: 0]
.TP
\fB\-\-maxrot\fR arg
Max. expected rotation in degrees. Used for internal
optimizations in DSP calculation mode. If a rotation
value will become necessary that is higher than
specified here, the algorithm will still succeed but
the calculation speed will slow down).
[Optional parameter, default: 10]
.TP
\fB\-\-maxtrans\fR arg
Max. expected translation in percent. Used for internal
optimizations in DSP calculation mode. If a translation
value will become necessary that is higher than
specified here, the algorithm will still succeed but
the calculation speed will slow down).
[Optional parameter, default: 10]
.TP
\fB\-\-stopsens\fR arg
Sensitivity of the STOP criteria for the gauss\-newton
algorithm.
[Optional parameter, use ranges between 1 (not
sensitive, stops early) to 0.0001 (very sensitive)
default: 0.7]
.TP
\fB\-\-nlm\fR
No Local Mimina: If this parameter is specified the
algorithm stops allready when the SSD difference
between two iterations becomes very small. If it is not
specified additional rules will be applied to calculate
better results in some special cases like escaping a
local minimum.
[Flag parameter]
.TP
\fB\-\-cdn\fR arg
Clip dark pixels until (including) the given luminance
to zero. This reduces image sensor noise in the usually
uninteresting dark pixels. A high value optimizes data
compression and calculation performance at the cost of
calculation accuracy.
[Optional parameter, range 0...255, 0 disables any
clipping, default: 10]
.TP
\fB\-\-nogui\fR
If active no GUI output will be shown. Use this for
batch registration of several images.
[Flag parameter]
.SH EXAMPLES
limereg \-\-tfile t.jpg \-\-rfile r.png     Shifts/Rotates t.jpg for alignment with r.png and displays the result.
limereg \-\-tfile t.bmp \-\-rfile r.tif \-\-nogui \-\-outfile o.jpg     Outputs the result to o.jpg, no GUI display.
