Lightweight Image Registration

The github project 'fimreg' contains an approach for fast image registration. It is meant as supplementary material for an article in a scientific journal and demands special and expensive hardware. This project - limereg - is a lightweight fork of fimreg where all code related to special hardware was removed. (It is no fork in a technical sense because I didn't see any benefit in having the hardware related stuff cluttering the version history).

It is a commandline based application that performs a 2D, rigid image registration on two greyscale images and outputs either the transformation parameters or the registered image.

The source code can be published as soon as our paper has been released to the public.
