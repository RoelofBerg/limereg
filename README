Lightweight IMagE REGistration

Open source and commandline based application and/or software development library, that performs a 2D, rigid
image registration on two greyscale images and outputs either the transformation parameters or the registered
image.

HISTORY

This algorithm for highly efficient Image Registration was taken from fimreg, which is a supplementary software
for our article in the Springer Journal of Realtime Image Processing with the title: "Highly efficient image
registration for embedded systems using a distributed multicore DSP architecture" which is available for purchase
at: http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11554-014-0457-3. There is also a preprint available free of charge
at http://embedded-software-architecture.com/Berg2014Highly_Preprint.pdf

If you want to understand how the algorithm works, chapter three of this paper is the best starting point.
Please be aware that this software is a limited research prototype. If you need industrial quality please
contact one of the authors.

The package builds two binaries:
a) liblimereg: (Mandatory) A library for software developers who need image registration within their application.
b) limereg: (Optional) A commandline utility for image registration, which uses liblimereg.

The optional utility limereg will only be built when libboost-program-options-dev and libopencv-dev are present.
If these prerequisites are not present only the library liblimereg will be built, which has no dependencies to
boost and/or opencv.

PREREQUISITES

Unix/Linux:
- GNU compiler (build-essentials)
- Optional: Doxygen (manpage generation for the library liblimereg)
- Optional: help2man (manpage generation for the command line utility limereg) 
- Optional: OpenCV (only needed when the limereg command line utility shall be built. Not needed for a lib-only version.)
- Optional: BoostCmdLineOptions (only needed when the limereg command line utility shall be built. Not needed for a lib-only version.)
An apt-get commandline for all prerequisites on Debian/Ubuntu would be:
sudo apt-get install build-essential libcv-dev libhighgui-dev libopencv-dev libboost-dev libboost-program-options-dev doxygen help2man

Windows:
Former versions of this library came with a MS Visual Studio project file. If you need MS VSS, just contact me at
rberg@berg.solutions.de and I will add a vss project file again (only if someone needs it). Currently this project
is based on the GNU build system (autotools/configure) and this toolchain is also compatible to Windows by using
compatibility layers like MSYS or Cygwin, just follow the steps below in an MSYS or Cygwin shell.

EXAMPLE RUN BEFORE INSTALLATION

If you want to get an impression of limereg before installing it, do the following (otherwise proceed with the next chapter):

 ./configure  CFLAGS="-Ofast" CXXFLAGS="-Ofast"
 make
 cd exe
 ./limereg --tfile ../tests/testimg/T_512.bmp --rfile ../tests/testimg/R_512.bmp --outfile ../mytest.jpg

You will see that the registered image (../mytest.jpg) has the content of T_512.bmp which has been rigidly aligned to R_512.bmp. 

BUILD AND INSTALLATION

A typical installation is as follows:

 ./configure CFLAGS="-Ofast" CXXFLAGS="-Ofast"
 make
 sudo make install

ATTENTION: ON SOME SYSTEMS (DEBIAN, UBUNTU) IT IS CURRENTLY NECESSARY TO CALL AFTER MAKE INSTALL: sudo ldconfig 
Like in https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=684981

For advanced installation options see file INSTALL. You may also want to execute 'make check' after 'make' for
executing the built-in test automation before installation.

MANUAL

After installation the following command opens the manual of the library:
  man liblimereg
and/or
  man limereg.h
  
To open the manual of the command line utility:
  man limereg

The project's web site has additional documentation:
 http://www.berg-solutions.de/limereg.html

EXAMPLES

Example code can be found in the folder named 'tests'. An example for the command line tool
would be as follows (after 'make install' was executed):

Display registration result on the display screen:
 cd tests/testimg
 limereg --tfile T_512.bmp --rfile R_512.bmp

Without GUI (batch mode):
 cd tests/testimg
 limereg --tfile T_512.bmp --rfile R_512.bmp --nogui --outfile result.jpg

TROUBLESHOOTING

The current version supports equally sized and greyscale pictures. For best results use image data centered
on a background. The average luminance of the four template image corners is used as Dirichlet boundary color.  
In the examples in the folder tests/testimg one can see that there light colored data is placed on a dark
background, which works good. As the background color is autodetected also dark data on a light background
would be ok. Any background luminance is fine, as long as the background is relatively equal at the image
edges (and present at the outermost image corners).

BUG REPORTS / CONTRIBUTION

Please report bugs or send source code contributions via github at:
https://github.com/roelofberg/limereg
(This is the base project that is used to create the source code tarball distributions.)

HARDWARE ACCELERATION

Limereg was forked from a software called fimreg that was written for the scientific paper mentioned
above. It utilized an Advantech DSPC-8681 PCIe expansion card that contains four TI C6678 highspeed DSPs.

If you need hardware acceleration also for limereg, please contact the authors. In our experiments we
offloaded the CPU by a factor 20 by using such a coprocessor expansion card.

OPEN ISSUES

There are severe limitations in the current version. But, however, the interface is designed for durability.
This means, the current version can be used for development and an upgrade will lateron remove the following
open issues without a changed interface (limereg.h).

- Currently only equally sized images are supported
- Currently the sizes of Reference and Template image must be equal
- Stencil images aren't supported yet
- Currently manual pyramid generation for searching subimages is ignored internally (but the interface can be used allready)
- One wasting image copy step is made when putting the image data into a matlab array. Elimination will
  speed up the software. (CRegistrator.cpp:98. Just change MatlabArray to reference to existing memory.
 Template: fimreg)
- The image rotation algorithm can be made more efficient (for highest performance use limereg to obtain
  the parameters and perform the rigid transformation yourself)
